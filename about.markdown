My name is Annie Li, and I am a sophomore at the University of Illinois. I'm pursuing a double degree in Computer Science and Instrumental Performance for flute, and I am also the Cultural Chair of the Chinese Language and International Development Society(CLAID).

I have been doing music for almost my entire life. I began playing the piano when I was 6. In 4th grade, when I was 9, I joined my school orchestra on violin, and I joined the school band in 5th on flute. I had a brief stint in my school chorus, but I (regretfully gave that up once I got to middle school. While I stopped playing piano shortly after I began playing violin, I continued violin and flute all the way up until I entered college, where I decided to focus on flute as my major.

My CS background has been a little more limited. My mom is a software engineer, so CS was always an option for me, but I didn't really become interested in it until the summer after my sophomore year in high school, when I participated in the [Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program](https://girlswhocode.com/programs/summer-immersion-program). From there, I decided to pursue CS in college, and the rest is history.

I was a Course Assistant in Spring 2020 for CS 125 (Intro to CS), where I held office hours in-person and virtually when the university went online. I also assisted in lab sections with about 20 students. I am currently a Course Assistant for CS 126 (Software Design Studio). Over the summer, I reviewed and edited existing assignment documentations for the course, as well as helped create new documentations. During the semester, I hold virtual office hours through our online platform. I also conduct weekly code reviews with 4 students, where I coach my students to utilize better design patterns in Java and C++ assignments. I grade their assignments each week and leave feedback for them to improve upon.
