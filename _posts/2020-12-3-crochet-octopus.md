Since I am currently at home instead of on campus during this quarantine, I have had more time on my hands and more supplies, and I decided to take up crocheting again. I've crocheted in the past before as a hobby, but it's always been very sporadically. Additionally, my yarn supply is pretty limited, so I'm restricted to projects only using very specific colors. Nevertheless, I found some simple yet fun projects to work on.

This [amigurumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amigurumi) octopus took me about a day or two to make. I used [this](http://esshaych.blogspot.com/2017/05/free-pattern-friday-mini-ami-octopus.html) pattern with the leftover yarn from one of my biggest crochet projects I've done, a crocheted cardigan, and a 3.5mm E/4 hook. It was relatively simple to make, and came out exactly as the pictures showed.

Welcome to my website/blog! 
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
