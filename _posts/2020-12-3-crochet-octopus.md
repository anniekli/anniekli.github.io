Since I am currently at home instead of on campus during this quarantine, I have had more time on my hands and more supplies, and I decided to take up crocheting again. I've crocheted in the past before as a hobby, but it's always been very sporadically. Additionally, my yarn supply is pretty limited, so I'm restricted to projects only using very specific colors. Nevertheless, I found some simple yet fun projects to work on.

This [amigurumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amigurumi) octopus took me about a day or two to make. I used [this](http://esshaych.blogspot.com/2017/05/free-pattern-friday-mini-ami-octopus.html) pattern with the leftover yarn from one of my biggest crochet projects I've done, a crocheted cardigan, and a 3.5mm E/4 hook. It was relatively simple to make, and came out exactly as the pictures showed.
